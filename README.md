---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c.  A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them. 

**CHALLENGES FACED**
- i. *Configuring Git*: after my successful installation while being guided by the instructors, my main challenge was configuring git because I kept forgetting to use the command, "git config --global user.email "my_githubemail" & "git config --global user.name "github_handle" **Solution**: I kept on practicing with git commands and github repo creations and deletions (for practice reasons)

- ii. *Git commands*: Proper and sequential execution of git commands to initialize a local repo and push or commit was confusing. **Solution**: I watched some youtube tutorials on how to use Git and Gitbash commands to ensure best practices.

- iii. *Errors during the Environment Setup*: I encountered errors at first as a result of my antivirus being active and continously blocking "controlled access admin permissions" to prevent system changes. **Solution**: I would temporarily deactivate my "Controlled access admin permissions" just so my installations could go through, which they did. 

- iv. *Configuring MySQL Port Number*: This was as a result of the default port "3306" already being used by "XAMPP". **Solution**: I had to change the for MySQL Community port number from "3306" to "3307" as this new one was readily available.

- v. *VS CODE EXTENTIONS*: Before having to engage with the instructor's lecturers, I had personally atempted to install extensions, then later uninstalled VS code. **Solution**: I received the proper guidance by watching the lecture videos setup by PLP LMS platform and additionally read the community recommendations
